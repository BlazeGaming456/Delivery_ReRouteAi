## 🎮 How It Works

### 1. **Order Creation**

- Enter delivery address using Google Places autocomplete
- Select from curated product catalog
- Review order details and pricing

### 2. **AI Route Planning**

- A\* algorithm calculates optimal path through warehouse network
- Considers distance, warehouse costs, and delivery efficiency
- Generates visual route with real-time cost analysis

### 3. **Live Delivery Simulation**

- Animated truck movement along calculated route
- Real-time progress tracking and status updates
- Interactive map with warehouse markers and route visualization

### 4. **Dynamic Rerouting**

- Modify delivery destination during transit
- AI recalculates optimal route from current position
- Cost comparison between original and new routes
- Accept or reject route changes with penalty analysis
