## üåü Overview

Walmart Flex is a cutting-edge delivery simulation platform that demonstrates the future of logistics through alogrithm-powered route optimization and re-routing.
This helps to retain customers who othrwise might not re-order dure to the additional cost, time required or the hassle.
Built specifically for the Walmart Sparkothon, this application showcases how intelligent algorithms can revolutionize delivery efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer experience.

### üéØ Key Features

- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Route Optimization**: Advanced path-finding algorithm for optimal delivery routes
- **‚ö° Real-time Rerouting**: Dynamic route modification during delivery with cost analysis
- **üìç Live GPS Tracking**: Interactive map with real-time truck movement simulation
- **üí∞ Cost Optimization**: Intelligent cost calculation with warehouse and distance factors
- **üè¢ Multi-Warehouse Network**: 14 strategic warehouse locations across Kerala (and India soon!)
- **üìä Performance Analytics**: Detailed cost breakdown and route efficiency metrics
- **üé® Modern UI/UX**: Beautiful, responsive design inspired by Walmart's brand

## üéÆ How It Works

### 1. **Order Creation**

- Enter delivery address using Google Places autocomplete
- Select from curated product catalog
- Review order details and pricing

### 2. **AI Route Planning**

- The A\* algorithm calculates optimal path through warehouse network
- Considers distance, warehouse costs, and delivery efficiency
- Generates visual route with real-time cost analysis

### 3. **Live Delivery Simulation**

- Animated truck movement along calculated route
- Real-time progress tracking and status updates
- Interactive map with warehouse markers and route visualization

### 4. **Dynamic Rerouting**

- Modify delivery destination during transit
- The algorithm recalculates optimal route from current position
- Cost comparison between original and new routes
- Accept or reject route changes with penalty analysis

### 5. **Rerouted Delivery**

- The item is now set to reach the new destination with minimal time and cost

## üè¢ Warehouse Network

The system currently operates across 14 strategic warehouse locations in Kerala:

It'll soon expand to all the states of India, and across the world!
